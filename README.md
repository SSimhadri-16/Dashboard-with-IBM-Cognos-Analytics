# Dashboard-with-IBM-Cognos-Analytics
Create dashboard using Cognos Tool
I utilized dataset from Kaggle. This dashboard is created with the purpose of tracking attrition rate of the company. It is broken down by male/female and the department they work in.We look at factors such as Monthly income, Job satisfaction, Job role, Employee count to gain some insights as to see if they are related.
